# Data Processing & Regression Models

This directory contains practical machine learning workflows focused on regression, feature preparation, 
and model evaluation.

## housing_price_regression.ipynb
This project builds a regression model using the California Housing Dataset.

### Key Steps Covered
- Loading and inspecting raw data
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature/target selection
- Splitting into training and test sets
- Building a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating performance using RMSE and R²
- Visualizing predicted vs. actual housing prices


## pyspark_cluster_setup_and_analysis.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates a complete PySpark workflow, starting from 
environment setup and Spark cluster initialization to performing distributed 
data transformations.

### Key topics covered:
- Installing and configuring PySpark
- Creating and verifying a Spark session
- Inspecting Spark configuration and cluster details
- Creating Spark DataFrames
- Running transformations (select, filter, groupBy, agg)
- Performing actions (show, count, collect)
- Understanding lazy execution and distributed processing
