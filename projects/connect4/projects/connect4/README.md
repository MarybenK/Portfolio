# Connect 4 Game Logic (Python)

This project implements the full game logic for Connect 4 in Python, including:
- Board creation
- Valid move checking
- Piece placement
- Player switching
- Win condition detection (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal)

## How It Works
The game runs in the console. Players take turns selecting a column. The program:
1. Validates the move
2. Drops the piece into the correct row
3. Checks for a win
4. Switches players
5. Continues until a player wins

This script can be extended into:
- A graphical interface (Tkinter, Pygame)
- A web-based version
- A Connect 4 AI opponent
