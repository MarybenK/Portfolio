# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This directory contains notebooks focused on understanding, cleaning, and preparing data for
machine learning workflows.

---

## 📘 eda_categorical_encoding.ipynb

This notebook focuses on encoding categorical variables for use in machine learning models.

### Topics Covered:
- Identifying categorical features
- Label encoding
- One-hot encoding
- Merging encoded features with numeric data
- Preparing a dataset for model training

📘 eda_outliers_and_imbalanced_data.ipynb

This notebook focuses on two important preprocessing tasks:

### 1. Outlier Detection & Handling
- Visual inspection (boxplots, histograms)
- Z-score method
- IQR method
- Removing, capping, or transforming outliers

### 2. Handling Imbalanced Data
- Understanding imbalance ratios
- Random oversampling
- Random undersampling
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

These techniques improve model performance, stability, 
and fairness in machine learning workflows.
